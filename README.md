# CHR
The V2 of the CHR chatroom, created October 31'st, 2025.
# NOTES:
Many bugs were fixed. There will be a daily updated website for the chatroom, at the end of this file.
The site will be changed daily, turning off at 9:00 PM every day. 
# NEW FEATURES:
Compared to the V1, several things have changed:
Tab Switching: If you click off of the tab, it will switch to a Chrome new tab page.
Commands: No new commands, as there is not a need for them.
UI: Dark now.
Server: Faster, more reliable than V1.3.2, as it being used with a daily NGROK page.
# FILTER
The swear filter is still there, so don't cuss people out. Your entire network will be banned upon swearing. So...don't swear. Simple.
# CURRENT SITE:
https://6d25a49b6652.ngrok-free.app/
Site may be a bit slow at times.
Bans last one day at a time. If you accidentally swore, or the filter glitched, unfortunately nobody will do anything about it. LMAOOO
